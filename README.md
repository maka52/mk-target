## Credits

* This was a edit QBCore Script so here is the original with the credits in the original script [https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-target]

* Lots of credits goes to [qtarget](https://github.com/overextended/qtarget) for rewriting all of bt-target to make it more optimized and this resource is pretty much a fork of it.

* Huge credit to [bt-target](https://github.com/brentN5/bt-target) from brentN5 for making the target a thing!

* Credit to [ms-peds](https://github.com/MiddleSkillz/ms-peds) for allowing me to use their awesome ped spawner inside the target!

Enjoy the script! :)
